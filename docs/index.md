<h3 align="center">tatva: Lego-like building blocks for FEM</h3>

</div>


``tatva`` (तत्त्व) is a Sanskrit word meaning *principle* or *elements of reality*.
True to its name, ``tatva`` provides fundamental Lego-like building blocks
(elements) which can be used to construct complex finite element method (FEM)
simulations. ``tatva`` is a pure Python library for FEM simulations and is
built on top of JAX and Equinox, making it easy to use FEM in a differentiable
way.


## Features

-  Energy-based formulation of FEM operators with automatic differentiation via JAX.
-  Capability to handle coupled-PDE systems with multi-field variables, KKT conditions, and constraints.
-  Element library covering line, surface, and volume primitives (Line2, Tri3, Quad4, Tet4, Hex8) with consistent JAX-compatible APIs.
-  Mesh and Operator abstractions that map, integrate, differentiate, and interpolate fields on arbitrary meshes.
-  Automatic handling of stacked multi-field variables through the tatva.compound utilities while preserving sparsity patterns.


## Quick Example

Create a mesh, pick an element type, and let Operator perform the heavy lifting with JAX arrays:


```bash
    import jax.numpy as jnp
    from tatva.element import Tri3
    from tatva.mesh import Mesh
    from tatva.operator import Operator

    coords = jnp.array([[0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0]])
    elements = jnp.array([[0, 1, 2], [0, 2, 3]])

    mesh = Mesh(coords, elements)

    op = Operator(mesh, Tri3())
    nodal_values = jnp.arange(coords.shape[0], dtype=jnp.float64)

    # Integrate a nodal field over the mesh
    total = op.integrate(nodal_values)

    # Evaluate gradients at all quadrature points
    gradients = op.grad(nodal_values)
```
